Have you talked to the other villages?/Show me what you know about Hanyu!
Well you do know your Hanyu! That's the first step to traveling to China./I wish you good luck on your travels!
You know your stuff!/We've been working on building more roads between cities so that it's easier and faster to travel between them./I would really appreciate it if you could help./Each city needs a different number of roads. Tap a city and then a city that is next to it horizontally or vertically to connect them./Sometimes you might need to build two roads between cities, if there are many people traveling between them./You can undo a road if you tap the two cities again./Good luck!
