Have you talked to the other villages?/Show me what you know about Hanyu!
Well you do know your Hanyu! That's the first step to traveling to China./I wish you good luck on your travels!
You're a master!/Now that you know so much about the language, do want to play a game with me?/I have a secret password made of colors. It's your job to try to guess my password!/When you check your solution, I'll give you feedback./A white square means you guessed the right color, but in the wrong position./A black color means you guessed the right color in the correct position./When you guess all 3 colors right, you win!
