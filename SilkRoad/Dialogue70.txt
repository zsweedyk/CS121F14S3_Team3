Have the other villagers taught you about Indian weather and geography?  I can test your knowledge.
Congratulations, you know a lot about Indian weather and geography./You have come a very long way. I think you now know everything you need to know to trade in India./Congratulations!
You know your stuff!/We've been working on building more roads between cities so that it's easier and faster to travel between them./I would really appreciate it if you could help. Here, I'll draw you a map./Each city needs a different number of roads. The black dots are cities and the number on them tells you how many roads they need./To build a road, tap a city and then a city that is directly up, down, left, or right from it to connect them./You can only build straight roads./Sometimes you might need to build two roads between cities, if there are many people traveling between them./To build two roads, just tap the two cities again./You can undo a road if you tap the two cities again after that./Good luck!
