Hello traveler./The language of the Indus Valley civilization is very diverse. Speaking to the other villages will help show you that./Do you think you have learned all you can learn about it?
Good job! You have learned the languages of India well./Best of luck to you in completing your journey.
You're a master!/We've been working on building more roads between cities so that it's easier and faster to travel between them./I would really appreciate it if you could help./Each city needs a different number of roads. Tap a city and then a city that is next to it horizontally or vertically to connect them./Sometimes you might need to build two roads between cities, if there are many people traveling between them./You can undo a road if you tap the two cities again./Good luck!
