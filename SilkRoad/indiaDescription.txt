Your name is Saanvi, and you've had some pretty bad luck recently. You live in Kaushambi, India, where there are frequent monsoons. These are huge rainstorms during the summer that flood everything and destroy crops and villages that aren't prepared. If the rain doesn't come early enough, though, crops will also die. Your family lost a lot of their rice this year.

Recently, traders from China have been seen near Kaushambi. The trade routes connecting China, India, and Europe have been growing and now cover over 7000 miles.

You want to make sure your family will be able to survive if your crops are destroyed during the monsoon season again. Gold, silver, and jade are very valuable in China. It will be difficult, but you are going to spend many months travelling to China to sell your family's jade.
