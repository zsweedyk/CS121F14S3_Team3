Have the other villagers taught you about Chinese geography?/  I can test your knowledge.
You truly know a lot about Chinese geography.  This will make planning out your route much easier./You will reach a Chinese town very shortly!/You've come a long way. I'm very impressed./Best of luck selling your jade!
You know your stuff!/We've been working on building more roads between cities so that it's easier and faster to travel between them./I would really appreciate it if you could help./Each city needs a different number of roads. The number on the city will tell you this./Tap a city and then a city that is directly next up or down from it to connect them./You can only build straight roads./Sometimes you might need to build two roads between cities, if there are many people traveling between them./To build two roads, just tap the two cities again./You can undo a road if you tap the two cities again after that./Good luck!
