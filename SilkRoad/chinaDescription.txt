The Silk Road, all of these connected trade routes, gets its name from the silk Chinese merchants bring to other lands. Now that you have succeeded in guiding Saanvi to China, there is someone else you need to help.

Your name is Zhang Wei. Your father is a wealthy merchant who frequently travels to distant places, so you don't see him often. You want to travel to these places, too, and learn how other people in the world live. Your father said he would take you with him when you were old enough.

You're old enough now, but your father hasn't come back in over a year. You know he was travelling to India when he set out. You think maybe if you can get there yourself, you might be able to find him. Going alone isn't going to be easy, but you're determined.
