Hello traveler./The language of the Indus Valley civilization is very diverse. Speaking to the other villages will help show you that./Do you think you have learned all you can learn about it?
Good job! You have learned the languages of India well./Best of luck to you in completing your journey.
Amazing!/Now that you know so much about the language, do want to play a game with me?/I have a secret password made of four colors. It's your job to try to guess my password!/When you check your solution, I'll give you feedback./A white square means you guessed the right color, but in the wrong position./A black color means you guessed the right color in the correct position./When you guess all 4 colors right, you win!
