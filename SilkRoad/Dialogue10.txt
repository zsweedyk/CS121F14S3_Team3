Hello traveler./I'm glad you're learning about Chinese currency./If you want to learn how money works in China you should talk to the other villagers./Do you think you could tell me what you know about Chinese money?
Good job! You have learned a lot about Chinese curency./Best of luck to you in completing your journey!
You know your stuff!/Say, could you help me with something?/I think someone gave me a fake coin. It's a different weight than the rest of my coins./Use my scale as many times as you want with as many coins as you want./When you find the fake coin, put it in the box on the left. Also let me know if it's lighter or heavier than the other coins.
